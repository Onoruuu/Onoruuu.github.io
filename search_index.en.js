The author calls this creating a \"Japanese Immersion Environment\" for yourself.\nI always saw learning languages as unlocking a whole new world of consciousness. You don't know what you don't know, so it's literally a whole new world. Different culture, different values, different life.\nWhen you learn a new language you become a new person in a new world. It's like you are recreating yourself, really.\nAnd to do it so intelligently, deliberately, is just amazing. This is what the internet ought to be. Making the most of what you have, not taking it for granted. Seeing just how powerful a computer is - not just technologically but how it can impact your mind, which is the greatest and most powerful resource of all.\n","id":"https://Onoruuu.github.io/blog/cool-website-for-learning-japanese/","title":"cool website for learning japanese"},"https://Onoruuu.github.io/blog/living-life-the-nixos-way/":{"body":"nixOS is a great operating system. My linux journey has been ubuntu --&gt; arch --&gt; nixos. Pretty much the perfect three distributions to sequentially go through. Ubuntu was my entry point, arch helped me understand things at a lower level, and going from arch to nix just further emphasized the power of nix.\nI'm not gonna glaze nix too much, I'm pretty sure you can find out, or you already know what makes nixOS so good.\nI like analogies. I find that they are very helpful for understanding life and reality. I especially love connecting two seemingly opposite things together, to see if there is a possiblity of a relationship between them.\nNixOS, something logical and nerdy. And life, something chaotic, mysterious, and unpredictable. Wouldn't it be so weird and wacky to combine these two together? To see where NixOS's design philosophy could apply into life?\nI think that in general, computers do make good analogies to life. For example, something I've always consistently told myself was the power of \"jailbreaking my mind\". When you jailbreak something, you unlock new and interesting features, never perceived before. You know that quote, \"You don't know what you don't know\"? The case is with your mind. Notice what happens when you gain an insight.\nGaining an insight is literally seeing something new that wasn't even in your consciousness before. Like, how amazing is that? Your mind builds this pressure from hardened contemplation and then all at once that pressure bursts into a \"Eureka!\" moment and you connect dots together and you have a complete paradigm shift.\nThose kinds of paradigm shifts are powerful, because the only reason you are stuck with whatever problem you have in life right now is purely because you are seeing things in the same old way that you have always been seing them. You are trying to head in a straight line to your goal but there is a brick wall blocking you. You shouldn't just continue to move straight forward, but rather go around the wall!\nAnyways, jailbreaking your mind means unlocking the artifical limits you place on yourself with your mind. \"Change the way you see things, and the things you see will change.\" The reason jailbreaking works so well as an analogy is because to jailbreak a phone for example means to subtly work around what is given and obvious. The same is with life. In order to grow, you must implicitly sense something beyond just the usual daily routine you go about, and sort of \"jump outside\" yourself; examine yourself from a higher perspective, and see whats not working from a detached state.\nBut back to nixOS. What makes nixOS so special? Obviously, it's declarative management which allows for immutability, reproducibility, and all those other buzzwords.\nDeclarative management is so special because you define your operating system and its components clearly and explicitly in one or more files which is usually located in /etc/nixos (or anywhere if you are using flakes!!).\nWhilst contemplating this whole nixos life analogy thing, I realized something:\nThe greatness of NixOS lies in its clarity.\nThere's this quote from the tao te ching, and I want you to pay very close attention to what it's saying:\n\n\"To clarify muddy waters, \nyou must hold them still and let things settle. \nTo glimpse the secret of the Tao, \nyou must keep still and quiet your mind.\"\n\nThink about how typical linux/unix systems work. Or hell, even windows. You download shit on the web or via desired package manager, and sometimes those things make changes to your system outside of your consciousness, which can sometimes be irreversible. Over time, your system gets polluted and messy, and you start experiencing system rot.\nIt just feels like your are choking and grasping for air. When shit starts to get bad, what do you do? You try to fight against it. You double your efforts and seek to find solutions. But all those solutions are band-aid solutions because the damage has already been dealt, and now you find yourself getting lost in the endless tasks of cleaning up your system.\nThe point is that you are running around. You are putting out fires. And in doing so you get lost in life's external details. I am transitioning from operating systems to life here. Think about how most of us live. It's the same as our typical operating systems! We do things unconsciously without intent. We hoard material items. We create bonds and ties that then weigh us down in the future, and we are forever stuck trying to fight against those in a hopeless struggle.\nIn doing all this, we are lost in the world without.\nWe have neglected the world within.\nThe world within, the inner world, is the world of all power. And this world can only be accessed through stillness and silence. (go back to the tao te ching quote!!)\nRemember how I said NixOS is clarity? And how the tao te ching quote says in order to gain clarity you must be silent and still?\nSo if you want to live life the NixOS way, you must live with clarity.\nThis means you declare your life, in the same way you declare your operating system with nix and it's functional progamming language.\nNixOS often gets a bad rep for its esoteric programming language, but everyone who uses nixOS says that once you learn it, it is so worth it because it saves so much more time in the end. Learning the language is a hurdle, and it's confusing and mysterious, but once it's done you are left with something amazing.\nSuch is the same with life. You must learn the equivelant of the nix programming language but for your life. That is the language of the inner world, of your heart. Your intuition. It's much more ambigous than the day-to-day things you encounter, but you must be willing to pay that upfront cost in order to yield much better results in the end.\nYou connect with this inner world via solitude, contemplation, self-reflection, and introspection. This is what allows you to gain that clarity. And once you have that clarity, then you can cleanly declare your life, who you want to be, your values, what you are willing to tolerate, how you want to live, etc etc. Then things can be simple, you wont be running around, feeling lost, feeling like a hollow shell to yourself.\nSo go now, live life the NixOS way!\n","id":"https://Onoruuu.github.io/blog/living-life-the-nixos-way/","title":"living life the nixOS way"},"https://Onoruuu.github.io/blog/move-with-gratitude/":{"body":"move with gratitude.\nlet yourself dance,\nlet your inner being stay quiet,\nlet yourself be moved by your own stillness.\nspin around and around,\nuntil your head gets so dizzy you start to see stars.\nthe spring waters of life flow through you.\n\nA short poem dedicated to the album Kagayaki.\n","id":"https://Onoruuu.github.io/blog/move-with-gratitude/","title":"move with gratitude"},"https://Onoruuu.github.io/blog/presence/":{"body":"life when you are present,\nnot thinking about things,\nnot spinning and weaving philosophy.\nbut just being.\nall is good, everything is right.\n","id":"https://Onoruuu.github.io/blog/presence/","title":"presence"},"https://Onoruuu.github.io/blog/rss-feed-readers-and-consuming-media-you-don-t-like/":{"body":"I've been meaning to get an RSS reader for myself, as the way I consume any kind of media is just totally split and fragmented. I just search up a YouTube channel or website I happen to remember on some random day when I feel like it, and that's that. Avoiding algorithms with stuff like Invidious, though.\nI decided on newsraft after reading vnpowers' blog post about it. Newsboat was the other option, but I just opted for Newsraft since it was more modern and nicer.\nAs I was setting the URLs up, I realized something amazing about this whole process: how it allowed me to see my own worldview at a meta-level. Zooming out and seeing the forest rather than the trees. I noticed that much of the content I've consumed throughout my entire life has been YouTube, and YouTube has been the primary thing that has shaped my life and how I live it today. Kind of frightening, but also mysterious and wonderful.\nSomething I've been concerned about from the start with doing a thing like this is confirmation bias. d-rens wrote about his own experience with exclusively using an RSS reader to consume news and media, and he mentioned how it did turn into somewhat of an echo chamber. It's great that he became conscious of it, though.\nTo counter this, I decided to make a section called \"Disagree\", in which I actively put a list of media that I disagree with. This is part of maintaining a practice of healthy epistemology, or \"epistemic hygiene.\"\nThis is what allowed me to really see my worldview from a big picture—not just the things I liked, but also the things I disliked.\nRecently, I've been waking up to the fact that life has no simple answers, that the truth of things is elusive, like a scurrying rat's tail you can only catch a glimpse of as it turns a corner. The truth is found in the silence between what is spoken, not the content of the words themselves.\nWhat matters is the structure, the system, how things interact with each other, rather than what one individual person is saying. Underneath everything is the truth, even in the most absurd or hateful ideas.\nAnd it would be wrong to create a bubble for yourself in which there are only things you love, which is what I inadvertently ended up doing by searching up what I wanted to consume (we gravitate toward things we are familiar with).\nAvoidance of truth is a game we always play. It's easy to see how others avoid truth, but it's hard to see for yourself. I recommend you research for yourself all logical fallacies and ways in which humans avoid truth: bikeshedding, strawmanning, changing the subject, and something I noticed in my own conversations—pretending not to know what someone is talking about.\nBeing a non-confrontational person by default, when someone brings up something controversial, my default reaction is to just pretend I'm stupid as a way to avoid engaging with the truth.\nThe same approach is taken in the consumption of media. Avoid anything controversial, only consume what you like. It's just not the way to go.\nPerhaps a tad bit unrelated, but a friend of mine recommended me the show Adolescence. I went in completely blind, and I was so fucking amazed by the greatness of the third episode. If you don't know, each episode in the show is shot in one continuous take with no cuts, which creates a deep immersion and a trance-like flow state. I didn't understand why they opted for this style until the third episode, in which two characters engage in this incredibly tense dialogue about red-pill incel MGTOW stuff that hints toward the truth of things. It gives a very raw and fresh perspective on this subject that forces you to jump outside the food-fight of the topic itself.\nThe point I'm trying to make here is to confront the things you disagree with or just don't like. Throughout my entire life, I just vastly ignored politics, dismissing it as \"bullshit\" and \"petty human games,\" which of course—like every perspective—is partially true. But on the other hand, conscious politics can give you deep insight into the nature of the mind, reality, and how things actually work, if dealt with carefully and precisely, like walking a tightrope.\nNow that I finally have an RSS reader fully set up, I see that my worldview is more left-leaning than it is right. Something I implicitly knew, but it was never as in-my-face as it is now. Having practices like these to keep your mind in check is such a crucial component of living a good life, so treat it like epistemic hygiene! It's like brushing your teeth, but for your mind.\n","id":"https://Onoruuu.github.io/blog/rss-feed-readers-and-consuming-media-you-don-t-like/","title":"rss feed readers and consuming media you don't like"},"https://Onoruuu.github.io/blog/software-minimalism/":{"body":"Just recently I moved back from my dorm and into my parents house as the school year has ended, and I realized that I just had so much.... shit, laying around everywhere.\nSo I decided to get rid of it. I decided that I wanted a clear mind. It's a new chapter of my life, and I needed a physical space that allows for deep solitude and reflection, not one that stresses me out and makes me run around dealing with things.\nI always had and intuitive sense that minimalism is the right way to live, but never decided to seriously act on it until now. I found some hipster self-help kind of websites, and decided to just use some of the advice they give. One of those rules was the 90/90 rule. If you haven't used the item in the past 90 days, and you don't plan to use it in the next 90 days, then you should probably get rid of it.\nThere was also the 20/20 rule which was something like if you could get it in less than 20 minutes and for under 20 dollars then you can safely throw it away.\nMuch of this kind of work was just letting go of the mental ties and baggage you had to your items. I realized that most of my items were already waste, and by refusing to put them in the trash I'm not only perpetuating waste but I'm letting that waste weigh my life down. Better in a landfill then in my home. It's a sunk cost fallacy kind of thing.\nAnyways, fast forward a bit and I find myself just using my computer to write notes and do system maintenance like any other day. Until it struck me: I could use the same rules for physical minimalism along with my computer!\nThe rules really aren't rules per se, they are more like probes that dive into your mind penetrating beyond your own bs so you can cleanly see the truth of things for yourself. Cuz it's easy to rationalize you could keep something, especially with software.\nSo literally just copy paste it and use it with anything related to computers or technology: if you don't plan on using x thing or learning y thing for the next 90 days, then you don't need it. There's a lot of great software out there to learn, use, and master, but they can be great time sinks. Oftentimes, whatever you have is already good enough.\nCadence made a great post about this.\nhttps://cadence.moe/blog/2021-08-02-overcomplication\nI find that space and distance do wonders to anything that becomes an object of focus in your mind. Whether it's a technical problem, a problem with a person, some issue you are ruminating on, continuing to obsess over it doesn't do any good. Sometimes the answer to your question is to not ask the question in the first place, as you are just creating problems for yourself.\n","id":"https://Onoruuu.github.io/blog/software-minimalism/","title":"software minimalism"},"https://Onoruuu.github.io/blog/the-man-who-married-a-robot/":{"body":"\n\nthe internet is beautiful, I miss the ugliness.\n","id":"https://Onoruuu.github.io/blog/the-man-who-married-a-robot/","title":"the man who married a robot"},"https://Onoruuu.github.io/blog/the-state-of-the-internet/":{"body":"Currently the internet is a self-sustaining echo chamber that is creating mass misery, suffering, pathology, and unwellness within society and the world at large.\nThe problem isn't political or social (although it is), it's philosophical.\nSlop is everywhere. So much noise. People talking. People talking about people talking. People disagreeing, fighting, arguing. Exponentially multiplied by the way algorithms on social media are structured.\nThis very article isn't immune to this effect, it is part of it. It is more and more complaining. Notice how much complaining there is on the internet, it's kind of fucking crazy.\nI'm asking you to be silent. Jump out of yourself, jump out of your own perspective, go meta. Put yourself out of your own perspectival bubble.\nIf I just continue to go on and on about how the current state of the internet sucks, what am I doing? I'm only serving to perpetuate the cycle that's already there. I'll just complain more and more, and nothing happens. Just more and more confusion, getting nowhere.\nSee, the problem isn't actually the internet. It's not the corporations and their evil intentions, it's not AI, it's you!\nWhat the internet actually is a machine of mass thought. Rapid thought. Thought that can be served to you faster then you could ever experience in real life. The internet allows you to browse through thousands of years of history, all of humanities discoveries, and all the knowledge that society has and is currently acquiring. It's this hyperspace that connects your consciousness to the rest of society's.\nPeople obviously recognize that the internet in it's current state is a problem. We all know that. But then what they proceed to do is continue to philosophize about the internet and worry about the future or yearn for the nostalgia of the past of the \"old internet\".\nMy entire fucking blog is all of the bullshit I listed above. Isn't that ironic? I'm talking about how people philosophize about the internet, as I philosophize about the internet.\nSo what's the solution? You are never free wherever you go. Trapped, grasping for air, choking on the staleness, every corner a dead end. Everything seems meaningless, nothing seems real anymore, the digital and physical world combine. You used to go to the internet to escape from reality, but now you go to reality to escape from the internet. Is this the existential challenge we have to deal with? Being born in this generation? How does one define their life amidst all this confusion? It feels like every path spins off into several others. In a maze, forever lost in the creation that is our own.\nThese are things I have to deal with myself. I'm no different then any other person, there's nothing special about me, but by navigating my own life experiences I feel like I've stumbled upon the solution to all of this.\nSilence.\nIn the absence of thought there is no you. There are no problems. They dont exist. A walk, a cup of coffee, washing the dishes. Observing yourself you realize you are the observer, not the object that is observed.\nIn silence life reveals itself to you. Any mysterious problem is solved with silent contemplation.\nMaking more noise about your problems will only perpetuate them. Rather, stop, look at the horizon, and realize you are alive. You are here, conscious. Your life is embodied. Dance, scream, whatever brings catharsis.\nThe problem with the internet is that it's just too damn noisy. There is no quiet, no solitude. No time to take in anything deeply. Everything just becomes fleeting and shallow, nothing of depth.\nBut you dont find depth in the content you consume or what you see or where you go, the depth is already and always there. It takes honest intent, slowness, and silence.\nThe answer is inside of you, stop looking out there.\n","id":"https://Onoruuu.github.io/blog/the-state-of-the-internet/","title":"the state of the internet"},"https://Onoruuu.github.io/cool-links/":{"body":"little gems and artifacts i've found adventuring the internet. forever a work in progress.\n\nyoutube channels:\n\nintrepid global citizen\n\nthis channel is a bit odd but in all it's weirdness it's inspired me and has given me great life advice. here's my favorite video.\n\n\nactualized.org\n\nfew people have influenced my life as deeply as the person who runs this channel.\n\n\nexurb1a\na_lilian\n\nbeep boop!\n\n\nsteinful\ncanadian in a t-shirt\n\nabsolute gold for learning about personal finances.\n\n\n\nblogs:\n\ncyuucat\ntatsumoto-ren\nvnpower\nd-rens\ncadence\nthricegreat\nsummerstorms\n\nthis is fucking hilarious.\n\n\nliterature girl\n\nmusic:\n\nspacecyberia (record label that coincidentally is a part of like half the anime dnb ive downloaded)\nmusic-college-tv (100+ videos teaching electric guitar. no advertising, no bs, absolutely amazing)\n\nmisc:\n\nfmhy free media heck yeah!!!\nwallhaven cool wallpaper place ooeeoooo\n\npeople you probably already know about but are cool anyways so ill put them here:\n\nluke smith\njames scholz\nno boilerplate\n\n","id":"https://Onoruuu.github.io/cool-links/","title":"cool links"}},"docInfo":{"https://Onoruuu.github.io/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://Onoruuu.github.io/about-me/":{"body":73,"title":0},"https://Onoruuu.github.io/blog/":{"body":0,"title":2},"https://Onoruuu.github.io/blog/cool-website-for-learning-japanese/":{"body":116,"title":4},"https://Onoruuu.github.io/blog/living-life-the-nixos-way/":{"body":590,"title":4},"https://Onoruuu.github.io/blog/move-with-gratitude/":{"body":31,"title":2},"https://Onoruuu.github.io/blog/presence/":{"body":11,"title":1},"https://Onoruuu.github.io/blog/rss-feed-readers-and-consuming-media-you-don-t-like/":{"body":408,"title":6},"https://Onoruuu.github.io/blog/software-minimalism/":{"body":253,"title":2},"https://Onoruuu.github.io/blog/the-man-who-married-a-robot/":{"body":4,"title":3},"https://Onoruuu.github.io/blog/the-state-of-the-internet/":{"body":334,"title":2},"https://Onoruuu.github.io/cool-links/":{"body":113,"title":2}},"length":12},"lang":"English"}
