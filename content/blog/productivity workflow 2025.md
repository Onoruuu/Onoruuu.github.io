I have a simple, 3-layer productivity system that I use to get stuff done, both personal and school. What I like about it is that, similar to blocks of Legos, you can keep endlessly unraveling and refining the system, and optimizations happen naturally as you use it, removing the need to be rigid and configure it all at once before starting. There’s a base I give you, and then some building blocks.

To preface this, I’ve tried [PKM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management), used Obsidian for 2 years, and briefly had an [antinet](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/introduction-antinet-zettelkasten/). The rabbit hole is deep, and I’ve come to learn that in reality, obsessing over these things doesn’t actually matter that much. What plays a bigger role in your being productive is setting the intention to live a meaningful and purposeful life. The system you use only does like 10 percent of the heavy lifting for you. The rest is up to you. So don’t take this stuff too seriously.

**Principles of my system:**  
- Portable  
- Flexible  
- Adaptable  
- Immutable  
- Atomic  
- Intentionally limited  
- (Mostly) analogue  
- Containerized  

My system is Unix-like, meaning that I have one object do one thing, and you can combine the objects together to do cool things or see stuff in a bigger picture. You can deconstruct the whole thing and only piece specific parts you want to see at a time to enable focus and clarity.  

“Immutable” and “atomic” might seem like buzzwords, but all it means is that the system works like what I said in the beginning: a bunch of Lego blocks you can build on top of one another. Or destroy and rebuild it in a different way.  

“Containerized” means that you can add a part to the system, and if you don’t like it, you can just discard it without affecting the rest. This allows the system to change and morph over time depending on lifestyle and circumstances, and since one of its principles is portability, you can bring it with you relatively anywhere.  

As humans, we have the tendency to hoard things. With this system, you often find yourself letting go of some parts as you change, which keeps things simple and avoids clutter. With my pursuit of Obsidian and antinet, I realized I gave more importance to information and managing knowledge than actually needed, which resulted in frustration and overcollection.

The system has three components. We’ll go from the highest level and abstract to the grainy little details.  

At the top level, I have a simple calendar app on my iPad. The iPad is outdated, so I can’t update anything, and half the modern websites won’t load—which is absolutely perfect. I don’t get pushed to update anything, and the calendar app just does its job with minimal distraction. As I said before, one device does one thing, so I try to use the iPad just for the calendar.  

I use the calendar for events, appointments, and scheduling things. Simple.

Below it, I have a 5x3 index card with an [Eisenhower Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management#The_Eisenhower_Method) on the back. This integrates nicely with the calendar. On the ruled part of the card, I have “metadata” for the Eisenhower Matrix. If you’re familiar with the Eisenhower Matrix, you’ll know that the top-right quadrant is for tasks to be scheduled. Whenever a task ends up in the schedule quadrant, I mark it with “>”, signaling “moved” (I’ll get to this more in a bit), and then I write the date and time I scheduled the task to be completed on the ruled side of the card. Then, I also add it to the calendar on the iPad. I’m not able to put into words just how brilliantly the Eisenhower Matrix as an index card is / index cards in general. Its small size forces you to prioritize, which is part of my principle of intentional limitation. In addition to being a funnel for the high-level calendar on the iPad, it also integrates well with the bullet journal, which is the third component of the system.

The bullet journal is the part of the system closest to reality, in the realm of “everyday” things. It is the bottom-most part of the system, where all the details are.  

I use a small, pocket-sized notebook so I can bring it anywhere. Conveniently, I actually use the Eisenhower Matrix index card as a bookmark for the bullet journal, which I find to be very powerful. I’m not able to contain my excitement about index cards because there are so many interesting ways to use them, which I’ll cover later.  

The legend for my bullet journal is simple:  
- “•” for a daily task (which can get moved into the Eisenhower Matrix)  
- “-” for notes: thoughts and ideas about anything  
- “>” for a moved task or note  

Though, there’s still one more part to the bullet journal: [The Cal Newport Time-Blocking System](https://www.timeblockplanner.com/#timemethod). The best ideas are stolen, and I decided to steal the shit out of this ’cuz it just works—and it also integrates well with the traditional bullet journal system. I have them side by side on two pages: one for the time-blocking, one for the bullet journal.  

As I said, index cards are fucking amazing. For convenience’s sake, I have pre-made cards of Cal Newport’s time-blocking system for specific days of the week. My routine on weekdays is different than my routine on weekends. Every morning, I use those cards as a base and write my daily schedule modified for whatever tasks and events exist that day. These index cards too are placed inside the bullet journal notebook along with the Eisenhower Matrix, making a really powerful system that fits right in your pocket.

That’s about the base of the system, but there’s so much more you can do.  

The “Lego blocks” of this system really are the index cards and the notebooks. If you’re creative enough, you can add cool things as you go. I needed a habit tracker, so I just got an index card, started tallying up my habits, and put the index card in the notebook—once again. The sky really is the limit here. You can keep adding more as you go, particularly in the lower levels of the system. I have separate notebooks for writing blog posts, ones for books, etc. I even use index cards as bookmarks for books and write notes on them. When I’m done, I put them in the bullet journal notebook so I can think about the ideas later. I needed a way to take notes for computer science, so I just decided to use a minimal Obsidian setup. Rather than use Obsidian for everything, I just used it purely for CS, following the system’s philosophy of containerization.  

In all honesty, it’s not that elaborate. It’s very simple and brash. Want to write notes for school? Then get a notebook for school and isolate it in that container. If you need even more detail, then split the notebooks into all different subjects, etc., etc.  

You might have some objections about scalability, like: *“What about keeping the knowledge from those notebooks after school? Do you just let them pile up in some corner and forget about them? What about integrating it into some larger system in a more elaborate way?”*  

Remember, intentional limitation and (mostly) analogue design are my principles. I realized that future-proofing and creating things of infinite scalability don’t really matter; they’re just games the mind seeks to satisfy its need for perfection and completeness. Just desiring more, wanting something perfect. It’s a game you can never win, so I find that it’s better to surrender to the truth of how things work, move on, and start actually living your life focusing on the things that matter. That’s what this system is about. I find that I can just let go of these things and then come to realize their importance isn’t as great as I previously imagined.  

Have a good day.
