Starting to realize that everything in life is a system. From my phone to my workouts to my daily routines, habits, and obviously computers. 

I feel like the reason so many peope are disillusioned, depressed, or nihilistic with their lives is because they lack the inherent creative vision that many innovative people have. 

My world sort of recontextualized. 

Read in this book that some guy saw that seniors in retirement homes were getting increased rates of depression due to not seeing other people for over a week. He also saw that people running on treadmills at the gym were a waste. You use up electricity and your run gets you nowhere. Sure, there is physical fitness, but can't you harness the power of running in a much more innovative way?

Look how much we take for granted the systems that surround us, and how we stay complacent and think that this is the best we can do, not seeing the obvious inefficiency in almost everything.

Some guy saw that inefficiency within the broader system of society, and so he decided to make something called "GoodGym". It's a service that allows people in retirement homes to act as "coaches" for runners. The coaches guide the runners towards doing community-aiding activities like picking up trash around the neighbourhood or whatever. 

The "coaches" get social connection, the runners get accountability. The runners also get outside and do community service, and so it boosts everyone's mental health and well-being. The coaches, the runners, and the people who benefit from the community service too.

Just one small example. There are so many other ways to be innovative.

You can sit and complain all day about how shit society is or you can actually get your hands dirty and innovate.

Doesn't even have to be in the collective sense out of some higher moral good. You can do it selfishly and personally. For your own personal problems.

Here's an entry I wrote in response to learning about GoodGym:



> "I just think this is so cool. It's genuine innovation. It's hacking a system in order to do something creative.

> With this idea comes a general idea in systems and how they work. For me, a great part of what gives me joy is managing the digital systems in my life like the consumption of information and technology. Digital minimalism, getting an mp3 player so I don't use my phone (and also jailbreaking it by intsalling rockbox) are just things that interest me so much.

> What this really is to me, is hacking. Hacking not in the computer sense but in the most meta way. Everything is a system, and hacking is seeing a vulnerability to be exploited in the system. Not in a negative way, but for genuine good and change like in the exampe here.

> So much things nowadays could use innovation and genuine creativity, it's just that people don't see life this way. 

> With life's problems you can be innovative. You could analyze your lifestyle and see cool and innovative ways of becoming more productive. WHether its incliding a morning routine, doing something during the day that keeps you focused. The little creative improvements that you figure out yourself just by asking questions like "how can I do this more efficiently?", or "how can I streamline this process?", or "What am I not seeing here?".

> It garners a sense of genuine self sufficiency and the ability to adapt, change, and innovate to whatever life ends up throwing at you. 

> I guess what's really the topic at hand here is systems thinking. Systems in the most general sense. The key to life is to understand it as a system and to play and tussle with it. Do bold and risky shit. Go the wrong direction. You'll get feedback; errors. And then you can keep experimenting and experimenting and you will eventually correct those errors and find the best ways of doing things. In a sense, life is like programming."

It's kind of nerdy and corny using cs as an analogy for life but its true. Just setting up this website was a dire pain in the ass. I went balls to the walls and dived straight in with literally no experience with site deployment, web development, or static site generators. 

What systems are holding you back from your highest potential?

Find it. And figure it out. Then aim to make change, in the most proactive way possible.

If you are stuck, there is just something you are not seeing. You don't have to will yourself through it, you just gotta think.
