take a second to comprehend how beautiful the internet is.

really, stop your tasks, stop spinning and weaving more thoughts in your mind and thinking about the next thing to do once you close this tab and move onto something else.

if god had a personal list of the top 10 coolest things he's ever made, the internet would take the first place. Without a doubt. Then maybe chicken shawarma would be 2nd. 

you'll find sorrow, ecstatic joy, weird corners, things that you will hate, things that will inspire and move you to your core. It will be a complete roller coaster. There is no other experience in this life like it.

it's really fucking special.
