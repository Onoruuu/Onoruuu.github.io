one of the greatest things ive discovered ever is vrchat. it made me see that the internet could be used in ways that promote genuine human connection rather than divide us. its this place of full and free creative expression in how you present yourself and how you play the game, which just cant be achieved in real life. you dont judge someone by how they look, because their look is their choice. it gives a mystical quality to social interactions.

I guess then I realized the potential of technology to promote genuine good in peoples lives, but its so sad to see that everyone is using it foolishly.

I always had a gripe with formal education and the american dream. it seems so outdated, and creativity isn't promoted.

creativity.

I keep saying this word. I guess its something I value. creativity, individuality, innovation, expression.

I think maybe I just want people to be themselves, not pressured to be sheep, following the herd. we all have our own beautiful and unique expression, and seeing that potential wasted with our outdated systems just hurts me. its just so damn inefficient.

the personal joy I get from innovation is indescribable, especially when I see it in other systems. there's goodgym, a thing where seniors in retirement homes act as coaches for runners, which gives both the runners accountability and the seniors human connection. that system has changed both the lives of the seniors and the runners, and it killed two birds with one stone. Having the vision for those kinds of things and executing on them gives you immense joy, and rather than just innovating for innovation's sake, innovating for something genuinely good for the rest of the world is just so beautiful.

people deserve better, the world deserves better. so much can be changed. we are still in the dark ages.

and I guess what hurts the most is the suffering people have to go through because of our inefficient systems.

this post was written as a prompt to chatgpt. was in the process of learning vim but somehow the conversation ended up philosophical. then this blurb came out.
