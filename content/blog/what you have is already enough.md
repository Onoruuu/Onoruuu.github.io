I like when I am using my computer and learning mindfully rather than being in a rush.

I'm happiest when I'm being grateful for everything I have programming-wise while coding. I find that I feel the worst when I try to fill the gap in my soul with "more." Chasing "more" just leaves me feeling empty in the end.

Just appreciating my Neovim config, my workflow, my knowledge of Unix, and how I use it all together, and seeing that **it's already really productive and neat** allows me to think clearly. I'm sort of in a daze when I'm in that rush to get the next and best thing, the most bleeding-edge thing.

The principles of minimalism do apply to our computers. In fact, they should be taken with greater emphasis because the computer allows for near-infinite accumulation. It's too easy to get lost in that.

You are actually more effective and productive when you are slower. That old parable of the turtle and the rabbit? It's so true. When you soak something in, you are not only happier but also more productive because you mitigate obsessive crashes and burning out by being gentle and soft with yourself.

I think that lots of us just have all these wars over the best software to use—like Emacs, Vim, etc. As cliché as it is, in the end, it doesn't really matter what you use. What matters is your relationship to computing and computers in general.

Look at the structure of something rather than its content. When you are lost in the content of something, you only change what's at the surface. But when you change the structure of something, that's where you can get real results.

You can change the top of a building by adding more floors or redesigning the roof or the upper structure, but nothing fundamentally changes about the building. That is, until you start messing with the foundation—then the entire thing can collapse!

I think most people who get into computer science eventually become cold and hard-headed about things because it can be a vortex you get sucked into of just chasing the fastest and best thing. But it's perhaps better to take a nurturing attitude towards yourself, life, and your coding if you want the most harmonious relationship between everything. It's a win-win for you, your productivity, and everything else.

Sometimes you need to relax and forget about your problems because life isn't about problems, or solving or fixing things. In the chase for more, you forget that what you have is already enough, that you can be happy now, that everything you need is already here.

And if you do want to optimize things or be faster, that's okay! Just take your time with it, enjoy the process, and don't rush it too much!

If you like learning computer science—or really, anything in general, I can't help but recommend the book Mastery by George Leonard. It's simple wisdom that teaches you how to learn anything. It can be applied anywhere, from the smallest things like cooking to your life in its entirety. It's generally a good attitude to have.
