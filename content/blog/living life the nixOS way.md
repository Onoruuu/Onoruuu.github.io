nixOS is a great operating system. My linux journey has been ubuntu --> arch --> nixos. Pretty much the perfect three distributions to sequentially go through. Ubuntu was my entry point, arch helped me understand things at a lower level, and going from arch to nix just further emphasized the power of nix.

I'm not gonna glaze nix too much, I'm pretty sure you can find out, or you already know what makes nixOS so good.

I like analogies. I find that they are very helpful for understanding life and reality. I especially love connecting two seemingly opposite things together, to see if there is a possiblity of a relationship between them.  

NixOS, something logical and nerdy. And life, something chaotic, mysterious, and unpredictable. Wouldn't it be so weird and wacky to combine these two together? To see where NixOS's design philosophy could apply into life?


I think that in general, computers do make good analogies to life. For example, something I've always consistently told myself was the power of "jailbreaking my mind". When you jailbreak something, you unlock new and interesting features, never perceived before. You know that quote, "You don't know what you don't know"? The case is with your mind. Notice what happens when you gain an insight. 

Gaining an insight is literally seeing something new that wasn't even in your consciousness before. Like, how amazing is that? Your mind builds this pressure from hardened contemplation and then all at once that pressure bursts into a "Eureka!" moment and you connect dots together and you have a complete paradigm shift.

Those kinds of paradigm shifts are powerful, because the only reason you are stuck with whatever problem you have in life right now is purely because you are seeing things in the same old way that you have always been seing them. You are trying to head in a straight line to your goal but there is a brick wall blocking you. You shouldn't just continue to move straight forward, but rather go around the wall! 

Anyways, jailbreaking your mind means unlocking the artifical limits you place on yourself with your mind. "Change the way you see things, and the things you see will change." The reason jailbreaking works so well as an analogy is because to jailbreak a phone for example means to subtly work around what is given and obvious. The same is with life. In order to grow, you must implicitly sense something beyond just the usual daily routine you go about, and sort of "jump outside" yourself; examine yourself from a higher perspective, and see whats not working from a detached state.

But back to nixOS. What makes nixOS so special? Obviously, it's declarative management which allows for immutability, reproducibility, and all those other buzzwords. 

Declarative management is so special because you define your operating system and its components clearly and explicitly in one or more files which is usually located in /etc/nixos (or anywhere if you are using flakes!!). 

Whilst contemplating this whole nixos life analogy thing, I realized something:

**The greatness of NixOS lies in its clarity.**


There's this quote from the tao te ching, and I want you to pay very close attention to what it's saying:


> "To clarify muddy waters, \
> you must hold them still and let things settle. \
> To glimpse the secret of the Tao, \
> you must keep still and quiet your mind." 


Think about how typical linux/unix systems work. Or hell, even windows. You download shit on the web or via desired package manager, and sometimes those things make changes to your system outside of your consciousness, which can sometimes be irreversible. Over time, your system gets polluted and messy, and you start experiencing system rot. 

It just feels like your are choking and grasping for air. When shit starts to get bad, what do you do? You try to fight against it. You double your efforts and seek to find solutions. But all those solutions are band-aid solutions because the damage has already been dealt, and now you find yourself getting lost in the endless tasks of cleaning up your system.

The point is that you are running around. You are putting out fires. And in doing so you get lost in life's external details. I am transitioning from operating systems to life here. Think about how most of us live. It's the same as our typical operating systems! We do things unconsciously without intent. We hoard material items. We create bonds and ties that then weigh us down in the future, and we are forever stuck trying to fight against those in a hopeless struggle. 


In doing all this, we are lost in the world without. 

We have neglected the world within. 

The world within, the inner world, is the world of all power. And this world can only be accessed through stillness and silence. (go back to the tao te ching quote!!)

Remember how I said NixOS is clarity? And how the tao te ching quote says in order to gain clarity you must be silent and still? 

So if you want to live life the NixOS way, you must live with **clarity**. 

This means you declare your life, in the same way you declare your operating system with nix and it's functional progamming language. 


NixOS often gets a bad rep for its esoteric programming language, but everyone who uses nixOS says that once you learn it, it is so worth it because it saves so much more time in the end. Learning the language is a hurdle, and it's confusing and mysterious, but once it's done you are left with something amazing.

Such is the same with life. You must learn the equivelant of the nix programming language but for your life. That is the language of the inner world, of your heart. Your intuition. It's much more ambigous than the day-to-day things you encounter, but you must be willing to pay that upfront cost in order to yield much better results in the end.

You connect with this inner world via solitude, contemplation, self-reflection, and introspection. This is what allows you to gain that clarity. And once you have that clarity, then you can cleanly declare your life, who you want to be, your values, what you are willing to tolerate, how you want to live, etc etc. Then things can be simple, you wont be running around, feeling lost, feeling like a hollow shell to yourself.

So go now, live life the NixOS way!
