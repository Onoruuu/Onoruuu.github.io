Thank you zola for teaching me much about computer science. Here's what I learned:

- SSH keys and how they work
- github automated workflow
- how to build and deploy websites
- much about navigating around the terminal 
    - a litle bit about vim 


Much more that I am too lazy to label. Right now I'm just testing out my workflow. Ive simplified things. The ssh key makes it so that I can automatically deploy shit without providing a personal access token. 

The automated workflow ensures I don't have to run "zola build" + "cp -r public/ * . " and also have to worry about lingering dead files that stay in the root "blog/" directory after deletion.

writing in markdown is very easy. No html. Thank God for SSG's.

Despite how "simple" this thing is suppoesd to be, it's pretty challenging for me, a total noob to computer science.

But I'm glad. I learned so many minute lessons that I Just cant list but they are stored in the back of my subconscious mind because I"ve learned those lessons through strife and pain and frustration. 

Thank you to chatgpt and deepseek for helping me learn this shit. 

There's so much to a website that I take it for granted.

I gotta keep polishing up my skills by taking on more projects. 

Still gotta add a theme to this.

God I take it for granted how it's as simple as edit the files then push them onto github. No more personal access token, no more running zola build and shit... 

See you on the other side!!
