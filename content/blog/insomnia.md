One of the greatest hallmarks of someone who has recursive insomnia (that is, insomnia that is caused due to thoughts ABOUT insomnia), is a high sense of hyper-logicalness.

You simply live life trying to perfect everything. Trying to have the perfect schedule, not be bothered when you are doing something, and it feels like you are constantly putting out fires that randomly come up, or playing an eternal game of whack-a-mole with your life. Finding problems, fixing them. This quickly becomes hell once you try it as you sleep, because sleep is one of the most counterintuitive things - trying to fix or “force” sleep only serves to perpetuate your insomnia, since sleep is something you can’t “do”, it’s something you “allow”.

This hyper logical mindset is there because of fear. Inherently, life is chaotic. Life WILL throw you curveballs. There’s no set 1-2-3 step way to live your life in a logical and rational way. Life is lived embodied, not from a distance. You have to dance with it. 

The refusal to dance with life results in you trying to plan out every step of your life, and since life is so sprawling and vast, this game is one you are bound to lose. You’ll just be in your head all the time, thinking about life, not actually living it.

When I had issues with insomnia, I thought about it from every angle. All the physical obstacles, mental ones too, even tried forcing myself to meditate and do guided meditations an hour before sleep, stop using blue light screens, heavy blanket, cool temperature room, fully shut curtains, etc etc. But it did fucking NOTHING. 

Because the issue was in thinking about insomnia itself. **Like a detective trying to solve a crime, but the criminal is the detective himself.**

This is why most of the advice online about how to deal with insomnia is useless (especially all those medical websites). The loop is this: 

You have a stressful day, or you drink coffee too late —> you go to bed, mind continually racing about the day —> you start realizing that you cant sleep, you try to force yourself to sleep —> the next day, when you are sleep-deprived, prone, and vulnerable to accepting any information given, you look on the web on how to “cure” your insomnia —> when you go to sleep, you become neurotic about implementing all this advice, which just serves to stress you out even more, stopping sleep.

So the answer for me wasn’t even meditation. Meditation doesn’t just magically solve everything, as some people like to think. It was having a philosophical dialogue with myself and trying to understand why I do the things I do. 

I came to the realization that my obsession with this problem is simply what is further perpetuating it, and it only is a problem cuz I made it a problem. 

If you are struggling with this kind of insomnia right now, I completely understand how defeating and hopeless it can feel when you can’t even get your basic need for sleep met. You start fearing the things you’ll do during the day and how you’ll act unconsciously.

But there’s a way out. For me, it was reframing my mind. I did the most counterintuitive thing. I told myself that I would stay awake as long as I wanted, and I wouldn’t sleep if I wanted to. I would read, listen to podcasts, listen to music, and do whatever I wanted to. I would set the intention to allow myself to be awake as long as I want in my bed, and not even need to sleep. It was this “paradoxical intention” that got me through my insomnia. 

All it takes is a bit of introspection and honesty with yourself. Rather than desperately searching for answers outside yourself, if you do a bit of self-reflection you begin to understand the mechanisms of your mind, and you can correct them by yourself. 

The problem is usually more internal then it is external. It is the way you see things. You know, that quote, “Change the way you see things, and the things you see will change”. 

Though, that’s not to say that I didn’t do any research in figuring out how to deal with this. I used a few resources outside the scope of mainstream insomnia advice:

- [blog post - insomnia as a self-fulfilling prophecy](https://meredithwalters.com/insomnia-a-self-fulfilling-prophecy/)
- [deepseek, lol](https://chat.deepseek.com). used it along with my own philosophical inquiry. helped me reframe things with analogies and metaphors.

Dealing with this kind of insomnia is sticky. It folds in on itself which is what’s so messy about it and it just feels like this labyrinth that you endlessly get lost in, each answer creating more questions. But if you stop running around for a second and look within, you’ll find that the solution is there.

And once you deal with this problem in your life, you garner a sense of confidence and self-sufficiency, because if you can solve something as sticky and messy as this, then you can practically solve any other problem in your life.
