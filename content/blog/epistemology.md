"Small, consistent action is the key to success in life."

Okay.

"You can't really find success in life until you take a giant leap of faith."

Hmm.

I'm sure there are some people in your life who would choose one of these attitudes over the other, and I'm sure you can pinpoint who those people are. Keep those faces in mind.

Now notice that these are two opposing perspectives. They are in conflict with one another. 

Yet notice that both of them are equally true.

We live in a society that prioritizes polarizing views over lived experience. Life can only be understood by being sensitive to the finely tuned nuances that underly our sense of reality. This takes several years or even decades of practice.

Balanced views are overlooked by polarizing ones because polarizing ideas are easier to hold and require less cognitive work, understanding, and nuance. 

Learn to value epistemology, as it's the most important factor that determines the quality of your life.
