I’m the queen of broken toys

The music box that don’t make noise

The friends I don’t have think it’s weird

I keep the things that disappear

I fall in love with broken glass

And wipe dust off of

paperbacks

I’m afraid of letting go

So I hold on to

For me, I always saw the internet as something beautiful and sacred. It was never just a means to an end, to get things done. Most of the things that have inspired me or moved me came from the internet. I have a deep love and sense of gratitude for everything the internet has done for me. It's made me who I am. 

I've always wanted to hold onto that beauty. Those digital mementos. All the people, posts, pieces of media that tugged on my heartstrings. But there's just too much. It's like picking up endless pieces of gold on the floor until your arms are so full and you can't hold anymore, so you just break down and cry and drop everything. Just knowing how much beauty you'll miss and you can't carry with you.

There's so much out there. There's so many cool people doing cool things, and you'll just miss out on that. That's something you gotta accept. True wisdom is facing up to that, rather then trying to deny it and somehow get the best of both worlds; you want to enjoy everything technology has to offer but you also want to experience all of it. You can't have both. You can only have one. If you end up in an endless search for more you'll be left with dissatisfaction, dissappointment, and that feeling of perpetuated grasping.

This goes beyond just internet and technology. This is an entirely new approach to life. You're grown up now. You've experienced moments of deep love, sadness, grief, and everything in between. Those memories, you can hold onto them. You dont need to archive them or to possess them to know that they happened. Life will go on. Everything is impermanent. What was once new will become old, and the face of your mother will wrinkle. You can either participate in this life or resist it.
