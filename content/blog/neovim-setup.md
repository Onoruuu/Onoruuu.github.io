Today I decided to start fresh with my Neovim setup. After uninstalling LunarVim, I began building my own configuration from the ground up. Here's what I accomplished:

- Removed LunarVim for a clean slate
- Installed python3-neovim (pynvim) dependencies
- Set up ranger file explorer for better file navigation
- Added ranger_devicons plugin for improved visual file indicators

I'm excited to build a more personalized Neovim environment that perfectly suits my needs. Next steps include setting up a basic init.vim/init.lua, exploring essential development plugins, and configuring custom key mappings.
