insert irrelevant list of interests here that will be forgotten in the next minute!!!

I like anime, computers, philosophy, music, etc etc. You've heard the same re-iteration elsewhere, I'm sure.

Really, what am I to you? I'm just a fleeting moment in your lifespan. A flicker. This website is my essence, and it will only be held in your consciousness for a short period of time.

I will disappear into the void of everything else you've ever read or seen on the internet.

What difference does it make who I am? The computer has communicated itself to you, under different names, different people, but really, it's all the same. there are no individuals here, just one being; the internet, and only the internet. 

It's just you and the screen, forever and ever. You will laugh, you will cry, and it'll be your entire life. 

we are in the wired.

we are all lain......

jk!!!

if you wanna talk about anything feel free to hit me up @onoruuu on discord!!!
