Hey there!

I'm Onoruuu.

currently a philosophy student at university, though I'm thinking of switching to cs....

this website is my own little corner of the internet. 

I kind of see this website as a gift to you, dear reader. 

The internet has made me what I am, brick by brick. Much of the things that have moved me deeply or have inspired me were from the internet, and so this is my love letter back.

I hope you enjoy your time here!
