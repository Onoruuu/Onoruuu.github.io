Hey there!

I'm Onoruuu.

currently a philosophy student at university, though I really want to switch to cs! I love both philosophy and cs just as much, and it's really cool to combine both technology and philosophy, probably a common theme you'll see throughout my blog posts.

this website is my own little corner of real estate on the internet. 

Hope you enjoy your stay!

(P.S - Feel free to reach out to me on discord @onoruuu. Whether you liked something I wrote or hated it, I am open to any feedback. Anything you say is okay!)
