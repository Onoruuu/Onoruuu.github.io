Hey there!

I'm Onoruuu.

currently a philosophy student at university, though I'm thinking of switching to cs....

this website is my own little corner of the internet. 

This website is a gift to you, dear reader. The internet has made me what I am, brick by brick. Much of the things that have moved me deeply or have inspired me were from the internet. This is my love letter back.
