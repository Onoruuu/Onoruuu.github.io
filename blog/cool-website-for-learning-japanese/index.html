  cool website for learning japanese
</h1>
<p class="subtitle"><strong>2025-04-30</strong></p>
<p>I found this really cool <a href="https://tatsumoto-ren.github.io/blog/foreword.html">website</a> for learning japanese.</p>
<p>It's a systematic and methodical way of rapidly learning japanese using free and open source software, brilliant.</p>
<p>The creator of the website has a github page with a bunch of little shell scripts and stuff that help you learn japanese (i.e gets audio from an anime and removes all the parts of silence so you can participate in passive listening while washing the dishes or something).</p>
<p>I just think it's so cool to sort of "hack" your life and change your environment in order to learn a new language. The author calls this creating a "Japanese Immersion Environment" for yourself.</p>
<p>I always saw learning languages as unlocking a whole new world of consciousness. You don't know what you don't know, so it's literally a whole new world. Different culture, different values, different life.</p>
<p>When you learn a new language you become a new person in a new world. It's like you are recreating yourself, really.</p>
<p>And to do it so intelligently, deliberately, is just amazing. This is what the internet ought to be. Making the most of what you have, not taking it for granted. Seeing just how powerful a computer is - not just technologically but how it can impact your mind, which is the greatest and most powerful resource of all.</p>
