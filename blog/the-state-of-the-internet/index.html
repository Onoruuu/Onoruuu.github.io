  the state of the internet
</h1>
<p class="subtitle"><strong>2025-04-30</strong></p>
<p>Currently the internet is a self-sustaining echo chamber that is creating mass misery, suffering, pathology, and unwellness within society and the world at large.</p>
<p>The problem isn't political or social (although it is), it's philosophical.</p>
<p>Slop is everywhere. So much noise. People talking. People talking about people talking. People disagreeing, fighting, arguing. Exponentially multiplied by the way algorithms on social media are structured.</p>
<p>This very article isn't immune to this effect, it is part of it. It is more and more complaining. Notice how much complaining there is on the internet, it's kind of fucking crazy.</p>
<p>I'm asking you to be silent. Jump out of yourself, jump out of your own perspective, go meta. Put yourself out of your own perspectival bubble.</p>
<p>If I just continue to go on and on about how the current state of the internet sucks, what am I doing? I'm only serving to perpetuate the cycle that's already there. I'll just complain more and more, and nothing happens. Just more and more confusion, getting nowhere.</p>
<p>See, the problem isn't actually the internet. It's not the corporations and their evil intentions, it's not AI, it's you!</p>
<p>What the internet actually is a machine of mass thought. Rapid thought. Thought that can be served to you faster then you could ever experience in real life. The internet allows you to browse through thousands of years of history, all of humanities discoveries, and all the knowledge that society has and is currently acquiring. It's this hyperspace that connects your consciousness to the rest of society's.</p>
<p>People obviously recognize that the internet in it's current state is a problem. We all know that. But then what they proceed to do is continue to philosophize about the internet and worry about the future or yearn for the nostalgia of the past of the "old internet".</p>
<p>My entire fucking blog is all of the bullshit I listed above. Isn't that ironic? I'm talking about how people philosophize about the internet, as I philosophize about the internet.</p>
<p>So what's the solution? You are never free wherever you go. Trapped, grasping for air, choking on the staleness, every corner a dead end. Everything seems meaningless, nothing seems real anymore, the digital and physical world combine. You used to go to the internet to escape from reality, but now you go to reality to escape from the internet. Is this the existential challenge we have to deal with? Being born in this generation? How does one define their life amidst all this confusion? It feels like every path spins off into several others. In a maze, forever lost in the creation that is our own.</p>
<p>These are things I have to deal with myself. I'm no different then any other person, there's nothing special about me, but by navigating my own life experiences I feel like I've stumbled upon the solution to all of this.</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>In the absence of thought there is no you. There are no problems. They dont exist. A walk, a cup of coffee, washing the dishes. Observing yourself you realize you are the observer, not the object that is observed.</p>
<p>In silence life reveals itself to you. Any mysterious problem is solved with silent contemplation.</p>
<p>Making more noise about your problems will only perpetuate them. Rather, stop, look at the horizon, and realize you are alive. You are here, conscious. Your life is embodied. Dance, scream, whatever brings catharsis.</p>
<p>The problem with the internet is that it's just too damn noisy. There is no quiet, no solitude. No time to take in anything deeply. Everything just becomes fleeting and shallow, nothing of depth.</p>
<p>But you dont find depth in the content you consume or what you see or where you go, the depth is already and always there. It takes honest intent, slowness, and silence.</p>
<p>The answer is inside of you, stop looking out there.</p>
