  rss feed readers and consuming media you don&#x27;t like
</h1>
<p class="subtitle"><strong>2025-05-13</strong></p>
<p>I've been meaning to get an RSS reader for myself, as the way I consume any kind of media is just totally split and fragmented. I just search up a YouTube channel or website I happen to remember on some random day when I feel like it, and that's that. Avoiding algorithms with stuff like Invidious, though.</p>
<p>I decided on <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Newsraft">newsraft</a> after reading vnpowers' <a href="https://loang.net/~vnpower/posts/software-i-use-v2/#newsraft">blog post</a> about it. Newsboat was the other option, but I just opted for Newsraft since it was more modern and nicer.</p>
<p>As I was setting the URLs up, I realized something amazing about this whole process: how it allowed me to see my own worldview at a meta-level. Zooming out and seeing the forest rather than the trees. I noticed that much of the content I've consumed throughout my entire life has been YouTube, and YouTube has been the primary thing that has shaped my life and how I live it today. Kind of frightening, but also mysterious and wonderful.</p>
<p>Something I've been concerned about from the start with doing a thing like this is confirmation bias. d-rens wrote about his own <a href="https://d-rens.xyz/notes/news/">experience</a> with exclusively using an RSS reader to consume news and media, and he mentioned how it did turn into somewhat of an echo chamber. It's great that he became conscious of it, though.</p>
<p>To counter this, I decided to make a section called "Disagree", in which I actively put a list of media that I disagree with. This is part of maintaining a practice of <a href="https://onoruuu.github.io/blog/epistemology/">healthy epistemology</a>, or "epistemic hygiene."</p>
<p>This is what allowed me to really see my worldview from a big picture—not just the things I liked, but also the things I disliked.</p>
<p>Recently, I've been waking up to the fact that life has no simple answers, that the truth of things is elusive, like a scurrying rat's tail you can only catch a glimpse of as it turns a corner. The truth is found in the silence between what is spoken, not the content of the words themselves.</p>
<p>What matters is the structure, the system, how things interact with each other, rather than what one individual person is saying. Underneath everything is the truth, even in the most absurd or hateful ideas.</p>
<p>And it would be wrong to create a bubble for yourself in which there are only things you love, which is what I inadvertently ended up doing by searching up what I wanted to consume (we gravitate toward things we are familiar with).</p>
<p>Avoidance of truth is a game we always play. It's easy to see how others avoid truth, but it's hard to see for yourself. I recommend you research for yourself all logical fallacies and ways in which humans avoid truth: bikeshedding, strawmanning, changing the subject, and something I noticed in my own conversations—pretending not to know what someone is talking about.</p>
<p>Being a non-confrontational person by default, when someone brings up something controversial, my default reaction is to just pretend I'm stupid as a way to avoid engaging with the truth.</p>
<p>The same approach is taken in the consumption of media. Avoid anything controversial, only consume what you like. It's just not the way to go.</p>
<p>Perhaps a tad bit unrelated, but a friend of mine recommended me the show <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence_(TV_series)">Adolescence</a>. I went in completely blind, and I was so fucking amazed by the greatness of the third episode. If you don't know, each episode in the show is shot in one continuous take with no cuts, which creates a deep immersion and a trance-like flow state. I didn't understand why they opted for this style until the third episode, in which two characters engage in this incredibly tense dialogue about red-pill incel MGTOW stuff that hints toward the truth of things. It gives a very raw and fresh perspective on this subject that forces you to jump outside the food-fight of the topic itself.</p>
<p>The point I'm trying to make here is to confront the things you disagree with or just don't like. Throughout my entire life, I just vastly ignored politics, dismissing it as "bullshit" and "petty human games," which of course—like every perspective—is partially true. But on the other hand, conscious politics can give you deep insight into the nature of the mind, reality, and how things actually work, if dealt with carefully and precisely, like walking a tightrope.</p>
<p>Now that I finally have an RSS reader fully set up, I see that my worldview is more left-leaning than it is right. Something I implicitly knew, but it was never as in-my-face as it is now. Having practices like these to keep your mind in check is such a crucial component of living a good life, so treat it like epistemic hygiene! It's like brushing your teeth, but for your mind.</p>
