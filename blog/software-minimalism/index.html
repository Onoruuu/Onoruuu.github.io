  software minimalism

<p class="subtitle"><strong>2025-04-07</strong></p>
<p>Just recently I moved back from my dorm and into my parents house as the school year has ended, and I realized that I just had so much.... <em>shit</em>, laying around everywhere.</p>
<p>So I decided to get rid of it. I decided that I wanted a clear mind. It's a new chapter of my life, and I needed a physical space that allows for deep solitude and reflection, not one that stresses me out and makes me run around dealing with things.</p>
<p>I always had and intuitive sense that minimalism is the right way to live, but never decided to seriously act on it until now. I found some hipster self-help kind of websites, and decided to just use some of the advice they give. One of those rules was the 90/90 rule. If you haven't used the item in the past 90 days, and you don't plan to use it in the next 90 days, then you should probably get rid of it.</p>
<p>There was also the 20/20 rule which was something like if you could get it in less than 20 minutes and for under 20 dollars then you can safely throw it away.</p>
<p>Much of this kind of work was just letting go of the mental ties and baggage you had to your items. I realized that most of my items were <em>already</em> waste, and by refusing to put them in the trash I'm not only perpetuating waste but I'm letting that waste weigh my life down. Better in a landfill then in my home. It's a sunk cost fallacy kind of thing.</p>
<p>Anyways, fast forward a bit and I find myself just using my computer to write notes and do system maintenance like any other day. Until it struck me: I could use the same rules for physical minimalism along with my computer!</p>
<p>The rules really aren't rules per se, they are more like probes that dive into your mind penetrating beyond your own bs so you can cleanly see the truth of things for yourself. Cuz it's easy to rationalize you could keep something, especially with software.</p>
<p>So literally just copy paste it and use it with anything related to computers or technology: if you don't plan on using x thing or learning y thing for the next 90 days, then you don't need it. There's a lot of great software out there to learn, use, and master, but they can be great time sinks. Oftentimes, whatever you have is already good enough.</p>
<p>Cadence made a great post about this.

<p>I find that space and distance do wonders to anything that becomes an object of focus in your mind. Whether it's a technical problem, a problem with a person, some issue you are ruminating on, continuing to obsess over it doesn't do any good. Sometimes the answer to your question is to not ask the question in the first place, as you are just creating problems for yourself.</p>
