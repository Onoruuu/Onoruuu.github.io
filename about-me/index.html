    <h1>about me</h1>
    <div><p>beep boop!</p>
<p>insert irrelevant list of interests here that will be forgotten in the next minute!!!</p>
<p>I like anime, computers, philosophy, music, etc etc. You've heard the same re-iteration elsewhere, I'm sure.</p>
<p>Really, what am I to you? I'm just a fleeting moment in your lifespan. A flicker. This website is my essence, and it will only be held in your consciousness for a short period of time.</p>
<p>I will disappear into the void of everything else you've ever read or seen on the internet.</p>
<p>What difference does it make who I am? The computer has communicated itself to you, under different names, different people, but really, it's all the same. there are no individuals here, just one being; the internet, and only the internet.</p>
<p>It's just you and the screen, forever and ever. You will laugh, you will cry, and it'll be your entire life.</p>
<p>we are in the wired.</p>
<p>we are all lain......</p>
