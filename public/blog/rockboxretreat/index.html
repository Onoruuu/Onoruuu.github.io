  Rockbox Retreat
</h1>
<p class="subtitle"><strong>2024-12-31</strong></p>
<p>Decided to go on a 3 day solo retreat to "think about life" or whatever. Wanted to bring music, cuz I didn't want it to just be an endless bout of silent contemplation, but a rekindling of the things that have inspired me; podcasts, media, art, music. Couldn't bring the damn phone though because we all know where that thing leads. Too distracting, too noisy.</p>
<p>Settled on getting an mp3 player. Like those ipods we had back then. We stopped using them due to the emergence of the smartphone, but there still is something inherently cozy about having just one device dedicated to music. It's like your little buddy that stays with you as you go around living your life. Listening to a sad song after a breakup, something poppy in a car, or something mellow on a walk. Having music downloaded feels more intimate and close than the lifeless streaming services we all have nowadays.</p>
<p>Ended up getting a relatively expensive one on amazon. Not an ipod, but it still had that sublime build quality. Wasn't made out of cheap parts. The heaviness of it was nice.</p>
<p>Of course, coming from listening to music via spotify, using an mp3 player was a pain in the ass. The original firmware on my mp3 player didn't fully display the album art and since I have a tendency towards perfectionism I decided that I am going to find a way to get album art to work.</p>
<p>Discovered this thing called "Rockbox", which is this properiatry software for a bunch of mp3 players, including the ipod. Had what I wanted: the ability to fully display album art. And more too (You can play doom on it lol).</p>
<p>Spent the next 3 hours trying to get rockbox on the player. Lots of troubleshooting, many errors. Lots of confusion. Chatgpt came in clutch though. I have the plus membership from my friends account which allows for the advanced model (it sounds eerily human) + the ability to use the camera alongside the voice model. The ultimate AI assistant. Ended up learning so much about how computers work. Realized that I can use AI to learn anything, as long as I have an engaging project in front of me and a desire to learn. Marveled at how much we take this shit for granted, and use it for something lame like cheating on tests or whatever.</p>
<p>Felt like a kid again. Tinkering, experimenting, learning. Rare for me nowadays. Rare for lots of people too I think. Consuming consuming consuming. Living like a zombie that eats information. Passive, yielding. Letting life unfold without any proactivity, engagement. Thought about how I needed much more of this in my life.</p>
<p>Finally cracking it and seeing the rockbox menu on my mp3 player was exhilarating. A different kind of reward than the hits of dopamine given to you on a silver platter. I worked for it. Error after error. So much troubleshooting.</p>
<p>Ended up experimenting with rockbox for a while. Different themes, tweaking the settings. I scoured the internet to customize this thing to my liking. Brick by brick.</p>
<p>Until one day I realized that my relationship with music was hollow. This thing was for music, wasn't it? I was supposed to just get the full display of album art, and that was it, no? The whole point of this fucking thing is for me to enjoy music, but I've just gotten lost in an endless streak of optimizing things. How stupid I was, I thought. How much happier I was with just the pure mp3 player, with it's shitty firmware, but that pristine feeling of owning something that feels outdated and old.</p>
<p>I've lost what I was originally searching for. Missed the forest for the trees.</p>
<hr />
<p>Shortly after my endeavor with the mp3 player, I found myself searching through my parents drawers for any scraps of old technology I could find. The mp3 player gave me a newfound appreciation for technology. Wanted to go back to simpler times in which we didn't have everything on one device, but rather each device served a different purpose in it's own clunky and unique way. There's a joy in that slowness, which is something I eventually realized with the mp3 player. Downloading music was much more cumbersome then simply clicking a track on spotify. But I cherished the shit out of the things I downloaded, and though I didn't have as much music, the pacing and quality enjoyment made up for it.</p>
<p>I found a camcorder with a box full of cassette tapes under my parents' bed. I found fucking treasure, I thought to myself. Pure. Gold. Tapes from when I was a baby, tapes from before I was even born! People at parties, no one on their phone. A capsule of time that can no longer be found now. How precious it felt going through those tapes. It was a special connection. Spiritual, even. Starkly witnessing the passage of time. How different my parents looked. How different the world looked.</p>
<p>How present we used to be, using technology to serve us rather than to eat away at us. That kind of mindful and intentional usage is found virtually nowhere now. Started to realize that technology is actually an amazing thing that can be the vehicle for a good life. I just took it for granted. Overlooked it's beauty and potential.</p>
<p>Reflecting on my relationship with technology, I realized that the internet is what made me, me. Other than my parents, friends, or teachers, the thing that has influenced me the most is the internet. It created me. I was born from it. It wasn't done intentionally. It happened unconsciously. And now I ended up where I am just by sheer randomness. What if I took control of the technological steering wheel? What if I built my life from the ground up, using technology to better my own life? What if I used it for the tool that it is, to serve and support my values?</p>
<p>Enter: Digital Minimalism.</p>
<hr />
<p>Fast forward a week after all these little technological realizations. I find myself in a family friend's house. Alone with enough food for 3 days. No technology other than my little mp3 player containing a select library of my few favorite songs and deeply life-changing podcasts. Revisiting the things that have inspired me. Brought one book with me to remind me what I was doing there. That book was The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho. Had all my journals that I wrote in for the past year or so.</p>
<p>I initially wanted the retreat to be a week or so, but due to constraints and holidays coming up I was only able to sneak in 3 days for it. Boy did I underestimate how emotionally taxing it would be. 3 days of hell is what it was. Time passed by so slowly, each hour feeling like a day. Each thought gnawing at my soul. Felt like I was being burnt.</p>
<p>In a good way, of course.</p>
<p>It was a cleansing, a purification. I remember crying for an hour straight on the first night. Sleep was basically non-existent. My thoughts and anxieties were keeping me up all night.</p>
<p>With nothing to distract me, what was left were the things I failed to face. The things that scared the shit out of me. For me, it was a lot of past trauma regarding my identity and self-esteem. Clearing up my past. Forgiving people. Forgiving myself. Acknowledging that I did my best and that now a new year awaits me, and that it is time to move on. I lied on the floor for multiple hours, just slowly going through this entire process. At one point I visualized my current self hugging my younger self, telling him it will all be okay in the end.</p>
<p>When you wake up and your goal is to only do one thing for the entire day, you get put in a trance-like loop that engulfs your consciousness into this void of forgetfulness. What I expected but didn't anticipate was the profound loss of meaning and groundedness to reality. You really are the things you do, so when you do nothing all day, and I literally mean nothing, then in a sense it feels like you are dying. This was basically living on the brink of insanity for me.</p>
<hr />
<p>Alongside all this madness, I re-evaluated my relationship to technology and just how much it impacts my life. I realized that the nature of social media is toxic, which sounds obvious, but you don't really get until you actually separate yourself from it. What you are doing, ultimately, on a platform like YouTube or TikTok, is you are propagating an idea. Hell, that is what I am doing right here as I write. I am flooding you with multiple ideas. Ideas are nice, sure. But ideas are not all there is to life. Just by virtue of using social media you give ideas more of an importance to your life then they should. Sometimes you take the ideas too seriously. You might take what I'm writing right now too seriously. Since there are so many ideas, like, literally billions of them, contradiction, paradox, and confusion is just bound to happen. One person says this thing, another person says another thing, who do I believe? It becomes this relentless pursuit of the "truth", which you think is noble and virtuous, but in reality is just neurotic and compulsive. Before the whole realm of thought existed online, you were content with what you have. The pursuit of "truth" is something you adapted unconsciously. You picked it up. Which means you can let it go. The internet creates a compulsive need to know. That's it's fucking problem.</p>
<p>During the retreat I realized I could just let go of my attachment to ideas, to philosophy. Not-knowing is a joy unto itself. A peace arises. Contentment with what I have. Grew up, matured, realized that hey, I've already discovered more things about life via the internet then any person 1000 years ago could've imagined. I have more then a lifetime's worth of knowledge, and maybe that's enough. Maybe I don't need to keep searching for more. Maybe now, I am free to live. To do as I please, to enjoy my life. And ultimately, the only reason I am here is to enjoy and live through the damn thing, not worry about finding the perfect truth. If I'm not happy in the pursuit of it, then how can I expect myself to be happy once I finally reach it, if ever at all?</p>
<p>The realization that I must be happy first. Now. Not "I'll be happy when...", but now. Now now now. All I have is now. All you have is now.</p>
<p>Draw closer, and feel between boundaries. That is the purpose of life. The joy is in the pursuit, the process. Every cliche is true.</p>
<hr />
<p>Slowly but surely, the retreat became a little bit more tolerable. By the third day, a sense of "okayness" was felt around me and everywhere. A deep assurance that life will unfold in the right way as long as I follow the principles of wisdom that are universal and timeless. Life will be my helping hand. I don't have to fight and struggle anymore. Quite the opposite. All I have to do is let go.</p>
<p>It's been about a month since the retreat. My relationship to technology and the world around me has significantly improved. I use my phone &gt;5 mins a day. Rock my mp3 player with me everywhere. At the gym, on a walk, at home. Love mindfully enjoying music. Found a dusty old Nikon digital camera in my parents drawer, charged it up again, put an SD card in, enjoying taking photos of the world around me. Got a Casio f91-W watch. Use the alarm feature to wake me up at 9am, use the stopwatch to time my showers, getting ready for things, and meditating.</p>
<p>No grand YouTube video or life-changing singular insight came about that caused all of this. That shit doesn't exist. It's more like you slowly work towards becoming better until you realize you are yourself again. So if you see this and you are inspired or moved by it, all you need to live a life closer to this is desire. Just want it, and it will slowly come to fruition in your reality. No ten-step process, no dopamine detox routine. That's all noise. Listen closely to what your heart is saying and it will point you in the right direction.</p>
<p>Also recontextualized my relationship with self-help. In the pursuit of improving yourself you forget the importance of acceptance and love, and to enjoy the process. Because the improvement of yourself leads nowhere, just death. The point of life is itself, so if you get too stuck in improving yourself then you will miss that point. Life is here to be lived, not to be rigidly beating yourself up for not being able to meet some arbitrary standard that you think you should live up to.</p>
<p>Just trust that you will find your way. Like a guided missile. You might go the wrong direction; perhaps even the complete opposite of what you ultimately are going to do, but you will make correction after correction, and it is by your mistakes that you find your way. Your own truth. Your own wisdom.</p>
<p>By no means is this an end to my suffering. I haven't passed a threshold in which now I am totally free. No one is totally free in this life. I will still backslide, I will still forget all of this. But in moments few and far between a lightning bolt of clarity will strike me and I'll remember it all again. Forget and remember. The only things I can do until the end of time. Again and again. Rolling the boulder up the hill...</p>
